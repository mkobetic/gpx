* emit srt, vtt file with the gps stats to embed in video files
  (need to figure out the best way to synchronize the track with the video)
* add heading info
* emit chapter metadata for video files 
  (e.g. each tack starts a new chapter)
* can we figure out prevailing wind direction? maybe with a rough hint e.g. E, S, W, N
